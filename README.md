# secure-serverless-chat-api

This Azure Function App provides a serverless backend for a secure chat application that uses the Azure SignalR service.

You will need to configure a ```AzureSignalRConnectionString``` in both ```local.settings.json``` and in the configuration settings on the Azure portal.

This project is the Function App part of the Solution Architecture diagram. The client (single page application) code can be found [here](https://github.com/mattburrell/secure-serverless-chat-client).
